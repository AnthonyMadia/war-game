# War!

## Description of Game:
♣️ War (also known as Battle in the United Kingdom) is a simple card game, typically played by two players using a standard playing card deck[2] — and often played by children.

💡 I decided to create this game because it was one of the first card games I played as a child and thought it would be cool to represent it digitially for my first DOM browser game.

## How to Play:
♦️ Playing the war card game is as simple as clicking the "Turn Card" button displayed in the browser. 

🔘 Pressing the "Turn Card" button will automatically render the player's card, the computer's card, and compare the two. 

🌟 The winner will have the loser's card added to their deck. 

⚔️ In the event where the player's and computer's card equal each other, "War" will be displayed and the winner will have the loser's cards added to their deck.
